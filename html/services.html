  <h1>Profit Improvement</h1><img src="../img/11.png">
  <p>Key Business Solutions can guide and assist your management group to improve profitability. KBS can provide operational, commercial and financial evaluations, appraisals, and performance improvement solutions. We have found that often, an outside party can be more objective and disciplined in reviewing the organizational needs. Collaborating with management, we will reach consensus on designing a strategic profit enhancement plan, tailored to your specific industry and organizational needs. However, plans are not effective if they are not implemented. Therefore, KBS can advise, assist or lead in the execution of your profit improvement plan. Successful profit enhancement points of focus typically include in-depth review and analysis of the following:</p>

  <h1>Sales and Marketing</h1>
  <p>Key Business Solutions offers a variety of answers to your questions about how to increase your margins and grow your revenues profitably. We communicate and work directly with your leaders and commercial group to identify and develop your value proposition. KBS can provide sound advice, analytical research, and comprehensive planning, training and execution in the marketing and sales of your products and services.</p>
  <p>If marketing is the process of developing a product or service offering, then selling is the most critical element of marketing which makes it imperative for customer-driven organizations. Often undervalued and misunderstood, selling skills are critical in growth organizations that rely on new customers, customer loyalty and repeat business. The ability to interact and build relationships with customers, while determining needs, gaining feedback, persuading them to make purchases and generating repeat business is at the heart of selling. </p>
  <div class="flex">
    <div class="col1">
      <span>Planning</span>
      <p>You won't acquire new business, maximize territories, and grow existing accounts without an intentional, specific sales and marketing plan. While you may find success, it will be sporadic and difficult to replicate. A more effective approach is a sales and marketing plan that aligns overall business goals with sales targets, and lays out a roadmap to reach them. The best commercial plans align sales with marketing and operations, and sets a strong foundation that drives the sales force. Focused planning and strategic thinking will uncover customer segments, market conditions, competitive analysis, and the best product and service offerings to focus on. This focused planning will guide sales and marketing efforts, distribution, and other business decisions, which ultimately means more bottom line profit to your company. KBS can educate and train your commercial team to understand and appreciate the preparation and planning necessary for success.</p>

  <h1>Workout/Turnaround Advisory</h1>
  <p>Key Business Solutions provides out of court turnaround advisory services to companies, management, banks and key stakeholders. Working in partnership with our clients, we provide an in-depth analysis of a company’s strengths, weaknesses and risks. Next we advise and assist with the development and implementation of a sustainable, value enhancing, and comprehensive strategy. Because there is more disruption and volatility than ever before in the marketplace, the ability to produce effective change to improve profitability and manage risk is more critical than ever. Shifting the organizational mindset to understand the breadth of change required to meet transformation goals is fundamental to the overall and long-term success of your organization. Change is not a one-time event, it’s ongoing.</p>
  <p><span>In a distress situation</span>, ownership and management must recognize the crisis situation for what it is and accept the fact that major changes are required. The sooner management accepts that simple solutions will not work, we can begin an objective process to identify problems, assess risk and develop a comprehensive strategy for turnaround. After communicating plans and receiving buy-in from key parties, we can then transition to execution and initiate business transformation. KBS workout services are developed for the specific needs of the individual business in crisis, and typically include a focus on:</p>

  <h1>Coaching</h1>
  <h3>Leaders</h3>
  <p>Key Business Solutions can coach your new and existing leaders to be more confident and effective working with their teams to plan and accomplish goals. A leader and a manager are not the same. Having a title doesn’t make you a leader and leadership is not an innate quality; it’s learned. Commercial, operational and administrative leaders can struggle if they haven't received adequate coaching to lead their team, or if they were promoted into a leadership role without prior experience. Support from a seasoned coach can make an incredible difference in transforming leaders in your organization.</p>
  <h3>Teams</h3>
  <p>Key Business Solutions provides coaching which supports teams and improves their performance. In today’s organizations, more and more work requires collaboration. Group efforts often yield much higher, more creative and comprehensive results. The good news is that most people want to collaborate at work, but becoming a ‘high performing team’ doesn’t happen overnight. We all know about the challenges that come with teamwork, from building relationships to achieving our goals and being clear on how our roles fit together. The KBS coaching method helps teams understand dynamics within the group to build effective relationships. Additionally, we help teams become more effective by agreeing on shared behaviors and how to reach their goals. Your KBS coach will nudge teams in the right direction by asking the right questions to keep teams moving.</p>

<h1>Resource Management</h1>
<p>Key Business Solutions helps you plan so that the right resources are assigned to the right tasks. Strategic resources are the main inputs that your company uses to create its value proposition, service its customers and deliver product. Resource management is the process by which your organization manages your various resources effectively. Crucial resources to your business may include physical resources, intellectual resources, human resources and financial resources. Many of these resources can be intangible or intellectual resources; people, time, brands, patents, customer lists or customer/market knowledge. Tangible resources include offices, warehouse and manufacturing space, inventory, equipment, technology and finances.</p>
<p>Resource management requires a thorough understanding and transparency into your objectives and capacities. By establishing a solid process for resource management planning, you’re maximizing efficiencies and optimizing the utilization of those resources.</p>

<section class="services-s8">
  <h1>Supply Chain Management</h1>
  <p>At Key Business Solutions, we believe that significant opportunities exist to improve the profitability of a company through managing and optimizing the supply chain. A supply chain is the connected network of individuals, organizations, resources, activities, and technologies involved in the manufacture and sale of a product or service. Supply chain processes have to be managed end-to-end. These may include strategic planning, sourcing, negotiations, supplier relationships, contract management, production planning, inventory forecasting, manufacturing capacities, customer segmentation and logistics. Our focus in designing an optimized supply chain includes physical, informational and financial flows across the end-to-end value chain.</p>
