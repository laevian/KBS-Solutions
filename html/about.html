  <h5>Testimonials</h5>
  <h1>Phill Cavender – <em>Senior Vice-President</em> | Metalwest</h1>
  <em>"I have had the privilege of knowing Paul Inbody for 25+ years, you will not find a more trustworthy, caring and transparent individual. Paul has been a mentor and coach to me for over 15 years of my professional career... Paul hired me in 1997 as a sales representative and immediately took me under his wing and helped guide me and my career to the highest level of success possible. My career would not have taken the course it did nor would I be in the position I am today without the direct involvement of Paul and his desire to coach individuals to the best version of themselves. Paul easily recognizes the strengths of those he coaches and mentors and focuses on accentuating those strengths while balancing the areas that need improvement."
  </em>
  <h1>Wade Hopkins – <em>Multi-Area Director</em> | Fellowship of Christian Athletes</h1>
  <em>“Skip has provided leadership in one of the most important roles we have in FCA, Board Chairman…His ability to walk with our staff in a serving, supporting role has been a tremendous asset to FCA. Teamwork is one of our core values, and Skip has displayed the ability not only to be a great teammate but to work with others to bring out the best in them as we all work together to fulfill the vision.”</em>
  <h1>Todd Berry – <em>Executive Director</em> | American Football Coaches Association</h1>
  <em>"Paul has a tremendous aptitude to look at a problem from every angle, dissect the issue and calmly look to the solution. Most significantly, he has the moral compass to do things the “right way” regardless of the pressure to take short cuts."
  </em>
  <h1>Jordan Conley – <em>Director of Sales</em> | Specialty Rolled Metals</h1>
  <em>“The impact and influence of Paul Inbody in my own career and life cannot be expressed
  by words alone. He is genuinely trusted for guidance, leadership and wisdom in all areas of
  need. Paul has a posture of service and willingness to help in whatever capacity he is able, which appears to be in everything. For me that includes mentorship in the steel industry, leadership when I entered management, and especially Paul’s insights and analysis to grow sales in a region when we needed it most. His gift of influencing greater productivity and growing sales is like no other I have ever seen.”
