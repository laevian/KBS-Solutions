by words alone. He is genuinely trusted for guidance, leadership and wisdom in all areas of
need. Paul has a posture of service and willingness to help in whatever capacity he is able, which appears to be in everything. For me that includes mentorship in the steel industry, leadership when I entered management, and especially Paul’s insights and analysis to grow sales in a region when we needed it most.
